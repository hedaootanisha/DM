Experiment No. 08
1. Aim:

To study and implement the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining using the WEKA tool.

2.Theory (Short):

Apriori is a popular algorithm used for frequent itemset mining and association rule generation.
It works by:

Identifying frequently occurring attribute combinations (itemsets)

Generating rules such as A → B based on support and confidence

Using the Apriori property, which states:
If an itemset is frequent, all of its subsets must also be frequent.

In WEKA, Apriori is used under the Associate tab to discover meaningful patterns from discrete datasets.

Procedure (Short):

Open WEKA Explorer and load the dataset (e.g., test.arff).

Go to the Associate tab.

Choose the Apriori algorithm (default).

Click on the algorithm panel to modify parameters such as minimum support, confidence, or number of rules.

Click Start to generate association rules.

Examine frequent itemsets and rules displayed in the output panel.
