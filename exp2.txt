Experiment No. 02

A.1 Aim:

To implement all dimension tables and the fact table related to the case study mentioned in Experiment 1.

A.4 Theory:

In a data warehouse, information is organized using dimensional modeling, which consists of dimension tables and fact tables.

Dimension Tables

Dimension tables store descriptive attributes that provide context to measurable data. They categorize facts so users can analyze information by different perspectives such as:

Time (day, month, quarter, year)

Product (item name, category, brand)

Customer (name, age group, location)

Region/Branch (city, state, area)


Each dimension table uses a surrogate key (system-generated key) as its primary key. This key is stored as a foreign key in the fact table.

Fact Table

Fact tables store quantitative, measurable data, called facts, such as:

Sales amount

Quantity sold

Total revenue


A fact table contains:

Foreign keys referencing dimension tables

Measures that represent real business metrics


Fact tables and dimension tables together support decision-making by enabling analytical queries.
