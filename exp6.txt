A.4 Theory (Short):

K-Means is a simple and widely used unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups data into k clusters based on similarity.
The algorithm works by:

1. Selecting k initial centroids


2. Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid


3. Recomputing new centroids as the mean of the assigned points


4. Repeating the process until centroids stop moving



It aims to minimize the distance between data points and their assigned cluster centers. K-means is efficient, scalable, and commonly used in pattern recognition, customer segmentation, and image analysis.

Procedure (WEKA – K-Means Clustering):

1. Open WEKA Explorer and load the dataset (e.g., file.arff).


2. Go to the Cluster tab.


3. Click Choose → select SimpleKMeans.


4. Set the number of clusters k (default is 2).


5. Keep other default settings or adjust if required.


6. Click Start to run the clustering algorithm.


7. View the results:

Cluster centroids

Number of instances in each cluster

Attribute distribution per cluster



8. (Optional) Right-click the result → Visualize Cluster Assignments for graphical output.
