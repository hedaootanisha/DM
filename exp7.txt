Experiment No. 07
✅ Aim:

To demonstrate Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering using the WEKA tool.

✅ Theory (Short):

Hierarchical clustering groups data into a tree-like structure.
It has two types:

Agglomerative (Bottom-Up):

Starts with each data point as its own cluster.

Merges the closest clusters step-by-step until one big cluster forms.

Divisive (Top-Down):

Starts with one cluster and keeps splitting it.

Agglomerative clustering uses distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean) and forms a dendrogram, showing how clusters merge at each level.

✅ Procedure (Short):

Open WEKA Explorer → load dataset (.arff file).

Go to Cluster tab.

Choose HierarchicalClusterer.

Select distance function (e.g., Euclidean) and linkage type.

Set number of clusters or use default.

Click Start to run clustering.

View cluster results and hierarchical tree.
