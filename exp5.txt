A.4 Theory (Short):

Naïve Bayes is a supervised classification algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem. It assumes that features are independent of each other (naïve assumption). Despite this simplification, it works remarkably well for many real-world problems.

Bayesian classification calculates the probability of each class given the input data and chooses the class with the highest posterior probability.

It is widely used in:

Text classification

Spam filtering

Recommender systems

Sentiment detection


Advantages:

Works well with high-dimensional data

Requires very small training data

Fast and efficient classifier

Procedure (WEKA – Naïve Bayes):

1. Open WEKA Explorer and load the dataset (e.g., file.arff).


2. Click on the Classify tab.


3. Click Choose → select NaiveBayes classifier.


4. Select 10-fold cross validation as the evaluation method.


5. Click Start to run the classifier.


6. Observe the accuracy, confusion matrix, and model details in the output panel.


7. (Optional) Right-click the result → Visualize to see plots or graphs.


8. To classify new data, choose Supplied Test Set and load the test file.
